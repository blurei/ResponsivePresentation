        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheet. Script adds all styles it needs for
        presentation to work.

        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.

        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?

        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

        To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
        a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).

        You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
        It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
        If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective

        But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesing things

            Here is where interesting thing start to happen.

            Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
            of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
            the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.

            Positioning information is passed through data attributes.

            In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
            and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
            will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.

            It will not be rotated or scaled.

            You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
            So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
            10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.

            You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
            as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

            So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

            * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
            * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
            * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

            These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
            CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

        Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.

        But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.

        When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
        gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
        so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
        the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.

        This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
        the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.

        ...

        And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
        It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
        In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
        probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.

        Just sayin' ;)

        Last, but not least.

        To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
        I strongly encourage to minify it first.

        In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.

        You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
        And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
        because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
        Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)

        -->
        <script src="js/impress.js"></script>
        <script>
            impress().init();

        </script>
        <!--

        The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.

        Just store the result of the call:

        var api = impress();

        and you will get three functions you can call:

        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
        id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
        but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.

        You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
        Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.

        For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
        is used in event handlers.

Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
you start...

Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?

You have it open in text editor?

Stop right there!

That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
first needs to grow in your mind.

So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.

Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.

Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.

If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about
creating awesome and engaging presentations.

Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.

For real?

I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like
to congratulate you personally :)

But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,
or anything you like to drink. And raise a glass for me ;)

Cheers!
